H. Liao, M. Tang, L. Luo, et al. “A Bibliometric Analysis and Visualization of Medical Big Data Research”. In: _Sustainability_ 10.2 (Jan. 2018), p. 166. DOI: 10.3390/su10010166.


???

## Volume

- Big data often has stupendous entries
- Columns represent different measurements
- Rows represent measured subjects / objects

## Variety

- Structured vs unstructured format
- Research context often relies on structured data
- Healthcare context often involves unstructured data (e.g. extra notes on
  medical records)

## Velocity

- Big data is expansive
- They grow rapidly
- Continuous flow of information
- Integration with automatic measuring devices

## Variability

- Unpredictable data flow (e.g. global COVID-19 impact)

## Veracity

- Different data quality

# The Scope

- Holistic: Biopsychosocial aspect
- Personalized medicine?

![](https://www.chcuk.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/RWE-web-graphic-1-Patient-Data-1.png)

???

## Holistic

- The scope of big data in medical contexts is enormous
- It incorporates biopsychosocial aspects of the patient
- Readily-available real-world data, yet currently unused:
  - Wearable smart devices
  - Fitness tracker application
  - Menstrual cycle diary
  - EEG kit and brainwave

## Personalized

- How do we use all the data to formulate a personalized advise?
- How do we design patient nutritional intake based on their daily activity?

???

#### Mindwave

- Record brain electrical activity
- Process it in a wavelet form
- Use it to communicate with computer (as a BCI mediator)

#### Smartband / Smartwatch

- Fitness tracker app
- See: HR, RR, blood pressure, oxygen level, distances, etc.
- Measure (recorded) daily activity

#### Period tracker

- A period diary
- Estimate menstrual cycle

#### Top Left

- Use EEG kit (e.g. mindwave) to track 24-h brainwave changes in epileptic
  patients
- Wireless pairing of EEG devices with smartphones, collect data locally
- Data sent to the cloud for further analysis: BCI, neurofeedback, seizure
  prediction

#### Middle Left

- Real-time analysis on data acquired from smart devices
- Output: Human Activity Recognition
- Implementation: daily-activity diary, for instances in Parkinson's patients

#### Bottom Left

- Conclude the functional homogeneity across different wearable devices

#### Top Right

- Sleep data recorded on smart watches
- Delineate chronotype of social jet lag in Chinese population

#### Middle Right

- Detailed relationships between menstrual cycle periods, follicular phase, and
  luteal phase
- By aggregating the data, self-tracking apps can predict ovulation day

#### Bottom Right

- Describes phenomenon among general population installing mental health apps
- Many people install and use mental health apps
- Only a small portion used the app for a long period of time

- Impact on clinical practices
- How researcher can utilize the data
- Knowledge graph

???

## Impact on clinical practices

- Prevention, early detection, prompt treatment
- Recognize vulnerable patients in contracting certain diseases
- Shorter hospital length of stay

## Data utilization

- Analyze the complexity
- Formulate a better recommendation with given evidence
- 

## Knowledge Graph

- Drug - drug interaction
- Metabolomics
- Network analysis

---

# Collaboration

- Inter-disciplinary research
- Multicentre approach
- Consortium
???

## Inter-disciplinary research

- Big data as a platform to centralize data acquisition
- *Every* field can contribute their findings
- More accessible data = better interdisciplinary collaboration

## Multicentre approach

- Simpler to maintain collective datasets
- Possibility of designing a real-time data sharing

## Consortium

- A consortium often requires contribution in a form of shared data
- International collaborative acts benefit all involved parties
