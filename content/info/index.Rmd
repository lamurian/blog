title: Who am I?
---

I am a medical doctor graduated from Faculty of Medicine, Universitas
Indonesia, one of the leading universities in Indonesia. Going down the rabbit
hole of understanding human behaviour, I decided to pursue a Master's degree in
computational neuroscience and neuroinformatics. My journey in computing led me
to an exciting world of statistics, modelling and data science, with graph
theory and geometric deep learning being two things I am most fond of.
