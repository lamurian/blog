<h1>Population and Parameters</h1>
<p>We often regard the society we are living with as a population, but what is
exactly defining a population? In a layman term, we may surmise population as

this interpretation may not present as the least imperfect definition, but we
can generalize the idea of “subjects” into entities of interest.</p>
