description: >

  So far, we have solved hypotheses testings for condition where we have numeric
  values as our dependent variable and categoric data as our independent
  variables. We have yet to see the solution if we have numeric variables for
  both of the dependent and independent variables. After learning the descriptive
  statistics, we understand that we can observe the spread in our data by
  measuring the variance, i.e. the dispersion of each data element relative to
  the mean value. Similarly, we can understand the dispersion of two numeric
  variables by accounting the covariance.
